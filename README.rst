What is this?
=============

Uploading photos to several services at once -- Facebook, Flickr, Picasa, 500px, with ability to select which photos end up where. The original usecase is to backup photos at Flickr, while choosing best ones to upload at facebook and 500px. This is also an experiment in Clojure and JavaScript.
